## <a id="proposal_header"></a>Project Proposal
The purpose of the project was to find at least two data sources, and use these to create a larger database which could queried to provide detailed information. We have chosen to look at video games data. We initially sourced two data sets from Kaggle â€“ one which provided information about sales data and another which provided information about reviews of the games. As these did not provide the full detail we wanted for our final data based we sourced a further data set from an API which gave a higher quality of review data.
